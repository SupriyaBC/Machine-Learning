# Guide: Dataset Creation to Grade Calculation

## 1. Dataset Creation:

### Purpose:
Generate a dataset containing student information and marks for various subjects.

### Steps:
1. Define the structure of the dataset, including fields such as Name, USN, and marks for each subject.
2. Choose a method to generate student data, such as using random values or predefined data.
3. Ensure that the marks for each subject adhere to the specified criteria:
   - ISA1 and ISA2 marks should be out of 40 each.
   - ESA marks should be out of 100.
   - Assignments marks should be out of 20.

## 2. Read Dataset from CSV:

### Purpose:
Read the generated dataset from a CSV file for further processing.

### Steps:
1. Store the generated dataset in a CSV file named "student_dataset.csv" for easy access.
2. Use Python's `csv` module to read the dataset from the CSV file into memory.
3. Ensure that the dataset is properly parsed and stored in a suitable data structure for further analysis.

## 3. Grade Calculation Function:

### Purpose:
Define a function to calculate the percentage and grade for a given set of marks for a subject.

### Steps:
1. Define a function that takes the marks for a subject as input.
2. Convert ISA1 and ISA2 marks to out of 15 each, ESA marks to out of 50, and keep Assignments as is (out of 20).
3. Calculate the total marks obtained and the overall possible marks for the subject.
4. Calculate the percentage based on the obtained marks and possible marks.
5. Assign a grade based on the percentage obtained, following a predefined grading scale.

## 4. Calculate Subject Grades:

### Purpose:
Iterate through each student's data in the dataset and calculate the subject-wise grades.

### Steps:
1. Iterate through each student's data in the dataset.
2. For each student, iterate through each subject and calculate the percentage and grade using the previously defined function.
3. Display the subject-wise percentage and grade for each student.
4. Optionally, aggregate the data to calculate overall performance metrics such as average percentage or grade distribution across subjects.

# Gender Prediction from Images Based on Hair Length Features using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement

The task at hand is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the gender of individuals based on features extracted from images, specifically focusing on hair length. This project aims to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn patterns in hair length from images and predict the gender associated with those patterns.

## Description

The provided code implements a simple neural network model using the Keras library to predict gender based on hair length features extracted from images. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Data Preparation:**
  - The code loads images from a specified directory, assuming they are in PNG format, and resizes them to a consistent size. 
  - Features related to hair length are extracted from the images, such as pixel intensity in specific regions.
  - The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.

- **Neural Network Model:**
  - The model architecture consists of a series of dense layers implemented using the `Sequential` model in Keras.
  - The input layer flattens the 2D image arrays, followed by dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
  - The output layer produces a single output for hair length regression.

- **Training and Evaluation:**
  - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
  - Training is performed using the `fit` method, with validation data specified for evaluation during training.
  - Predictions are made on the test images, and the predicted hair lengths are mapped to gender labels (e.g., 'Male' or 'Female') based on a threshold.

- **Visualization:**
  - The code includes functionality to display the predicted gender for each test image along with the image itself.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic approach to gender prediction from images based on hair length features using neural networks. Further improvements could involve experimenting with different architectures, augmenting the dataset, and incorporating additional features for more accurate predictions.
