# Gender Prediction from Images Based on Hair Length Features using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement

The task at hand is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the gender of individuals based on features extracted from images, specifically focusing on hair length. This project aims to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn patterns in hair length from images and predict the gender associated with those patterns.

## Description

The provided code implements a simple neural network model using the Keras library to predict gender based on hair length features extracted from images. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Data Preparation:**
  - The code loads images from a specified directory, assuming they are in PNG format, and resizes them to a consistent size. 
  - Features related to hair length are extracted from the images, such as pixel intensity in specific regions.
  - The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.

- **Neural Network Model:**
  - The model architecture consists of a series of dense layers implemented using the `Sequential` model in Keras.
  - The input layer flattens the 2D image arrays, followed by dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
  - The output layer produces a single output for hair length regression.

- **Training and Evaluation:**
  - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
  - Training is performed using the `fit` method, with validation data specified for evaluation during training.
  - Predictions are made on the test images, and the predicted hair lengths are mapped to gender labels (e.g., 'Male' or 'Female') based on a threshold.

- **Visualization:**
  - The code includes functionality to display the predicted gender for each test image along with the image itself.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic approach to gender prediction from images based on hair length features using neural networks. Further improvements could involve experimenting with different architectures, augmenting the dataset, and incorporating additional features for more accurate predictions.
